#### Data Science with R - A set of examples
Welcome to the githib resource containing interesting examples of applying R to a range of data science problems, including:

* **Text Mining**, with an example that creates a wordcloud from the opening chapter of Ulysses (Episode 1 - Telemachus) by James Joyce. Code based on the nice example of [wordclouds in R](https://georeferenced.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/rwordcloud/) already published on the web, and also using the available online text for [Ulysses](http://www.online-literature.com/james_joyce/ulysses/1/). For more information on text mining, see [wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining) and the [tm package in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/vignettes/tm.pdf)
